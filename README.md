## 1. Overview

ElasticArcFace is an advanced face recognition framework that integrates:

- **ArcFace (Additive Angular Margin Loss)**
- **ElasticNet Regularization (ElasticFace)**
- **AdaFace (Quality Adaptive Margin)**
- **Self-Attention modules** (for enhanced feature extraction)

The goal is to improve recognition accuracy, especially in difficult conditions such as pose variations, occlusions, or low-quality images.

## 2. Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
!pip install tensorboard
!pip install easydict
!pip install mxnet
!pip install onnx
!pip install scikit-learn
```

## 3. Attention Fix for MXNet (Optional)
For some versions of MXNet, you might encounter compatibility warnings regarding bool.
Fix it using the following command:

```bash
sed -i 's/bool = onp.bool/bool = bool/' /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/mxnet/numpy/utils.py

```

## 4. Dataset Preparation

ElasticArcFace is compatible with various face recognition datasets such as:

- **MS1MV2**

You can use the public datasets provided by [InsightFace Datasets Repository](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition/_datasets_).
